Frontend and Backend are components of a computing system and they cooperate to give users intended experience. Every system has these components and it depends on users i.e their behavioral pattern how much each component has to be enhanced.

Here, in this blog we will be talking about a component which one cant ignore and fits into behavioral pattern of all users - **Backend**. All users want their work to be consistent, available and in-time but presentation of work may not concern to some class of users.

Backend can be simply be said as what user can't see, which is I think is perfect definition. Backend is a relative term and can mean different to different entities working on different things. Here we will be talking about computation systems which process user's query and answers to it.

### Server

Server means simply a computer which can serve requests of users. To make accepting request structured and standard way APIs were introduced. 

API(Application Programming Interface) acts bridge component between systems. For example bridge between Frontend and Backend. There can be multiple components in Backend itself and use APIs to communicate. APIs have some rules defined to communicate between components like what data is being communicated and its structure i.e JSON, XML or plain text. 

Once server gets request, it is parsed and processed and reply is sent to requesting system(it may be Frontend).

APIs are made up of endpoints which are like taps in Backend system. We simply send a request to tap where we intend to do some logical operation on the data we sent and get a reply. It is like different doors of house used for different usage.

### Database

Databases are used to store and retrive data efficiently. Frontend requests Backend for data which is retrived from database, processed and then sent to Frontend. Databases internally utilise Data Structures for optimisation.

This was the surface level overview of some components of backend and there are more which we will discuss later in the series. I know your curious mind have raised questions, try exploring them. You can always contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suyashc/). 

### Some curious questions

* In which language APIs and Servers written?
* What is JSON, XML?
* How can we retrive data from database?
* Generally Servers run which Operating System?
